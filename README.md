This is a MERN (MongoDB, express, react, nodeJS) stack application. It fetches data from the MovieDB API and populates a grid with the latest movies added on IMDB. You can search for a specific movie by adding its tag on the address bar i.e: http://localhost:3000/movie/587807. A search bar feature was to be developed but this can be a future feature to be added.

To use this application,

1. If you're using VS code open the project inside VS code, open a new terminal and run npm i to install dependencies.
2. Do the same as step 1 but this time cd into the client folder
3. to run the application cd into the project's main folder (\React-movie-app) and run "npm run dev". A window will open on your default browser on localhost:3000.
